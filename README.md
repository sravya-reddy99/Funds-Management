### ✅ TODO

We are evaluating you based on your front-end and back-end capabilities. Please complete the task to the best of your abilities.

#### Components to Implement

You are expected to create at least **three components**:

---

#### 1. Admin Data Table View

- Create an API function that fetches data from `backend/data/funds_data.json`.
- Display the data in a table format.
- Create Filters for each property in the dataset to be able to get select values.
- Allow the admin to sort the dataset in the table; organizing by least to greatest, greatest to least.. etc
- Style the table using your best UI/UX judgment.
- When clicking on the **Name** of a data point, navigate to the **User Facing Data View**.
- Include an edit icon (e.g., a pencil) that navigates to the **Admin Edit View**.

---

#### 2. User Facing Data View

- Create an API function to fetch a **single data point** from `backend/data/funds_data.json`.
- Display all available information for that data point.
- Style the view using your best UI/UX judgment.

#### 3. Admin Edit View

- Create an API function to fetch and edit a **single data point** from `backend/data/funds_data.json`.
- Allow the admin to **edit** and **delete** the data.
- Automatically save changes when the admin finishes editing.
- Design the view using your best UI/UX judgment.
- You may implement this as a **separate page** or a **modal/dialog** (e.g., MatDialog).

- Message: Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment. I really enjoyed building this project and focused on implementing both the frontend and backend thoroughly.
On the backend, I created the required APIs to fetch, update, and delete data from the JSON file, ensuring changes are persisted properly. On the frontend, I built the Admin Data Table with filtering, sorting, and pagination, along with a user-friendly detail view and an auto-saving admin edit view.
I also spent time improving the UI to make it clean, modern, and visually engaging while keeping the experience intuitive.
I look forward to your feedback!
